## Tech notes

My tech notes aim to be a place where I can share research and learnings. The notes may hopefully be useful to others and at the same time sharpen my explanatory ablilities.

To ensure usefulness and regular updates, I plan to approach my tech notes in much the same way as my software. Pick a problem which you feel you can accomplish in a reasonable time and deliver it end-to-end. Once delivered, the feedback of information can start and improvements, learnings and expansion of insight into the original problem can start. This can be expressed as being:

* Brief
* Focused, each addressing a single topic
* Modular, so you can reference only the topics relevant to your goals
* Complete, with sample code illustrating each topic
* Dynamic, updated and expanded as needed
* Free and open
