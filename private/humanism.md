## Spirituality/humanism



"It involves opening our hearts and culti- vating our capacity to experience awe, reverence, and gratitude. It is the ability to see the sacred in the ordinary, to feel the poignancy of life, to know the passion of existence and to give ourselves over to that which is greater than ourselves"
David Elkins

[Where sacred being defined secularly. "we might understand what’s sacred for an individual as simply that which they cherish, or hold dear"][1]


"The religious seek inspiration from the supernatural and the Church, Synagogue, or Mosque; the non-religious look for it in mortal love—the love of hu- mans for other humans, not the holy love of God, Christ, or Allah (or any other divine, worshipful being). "

"The secular quest for spirituality also includes identifying ourselves as part of a larger commu- nity, as well as developing a vital, enthusiastic involvement with nature, the arts, and science. Here spiritual fulfillment equates with feeling fully, energetically, vibrantly alive and connected to others, as well as to the broader environment we live in. "

"And immersing ourselves in nature—whether it be up in the mountains, down in the valleys, or by a brook, river, or ocean—offers us a similar experience of “oneness,” of becoming part of something far beyond ourselves. It can, I think, legitimately be seen as an expansion of self, a liberation of our spirit."
